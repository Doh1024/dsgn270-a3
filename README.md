# Design concept
The design concept I was going for in my logo was a friendly, simple, and cute optical shop logo. It's pretty clear that what the logo is about, and it isn't too formal looking unlike other optical shop logos. I didn't have the glasses fram and the eyes grouped because I think if I were to add any kind of animations to the logo, I would want to animate those 2 seperately.

## Journal entry
It took me a long time to actually get the logos going because I
couldn't decide on what kind of logo I should make and how I wanted it to look. Also needed to do some research on figma tools and how to curve texts but other then that, I didn't have much problems with exporting, svgomg, and css.
